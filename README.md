# Terminal Aliases

These are some aliases that I created to help me in software developing. There
are some General Unix, Docker and Git commands to favor speed when using
commands

## Using

Just insert the `.aliases.local` in your home folder and make sure that
`.aliases` have something like this:

```
[[ -f ~/.aliases.local ]] && source ~/.aliases.local
```
